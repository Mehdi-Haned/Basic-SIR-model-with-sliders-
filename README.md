# Basic-SIR-model-with-sliders-
This is a basic SIR model for modeling epidemics that is also interactive with two sliders. I am actually proud of this one

Notes:
- this uses the following modules: Matpllotlib(for plotting), scipy(for solving equations), and Numpy (for using arrays) 
  make sure you have all of these before you run the code.
